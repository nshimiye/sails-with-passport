 Method                                         | What it does
 ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `req.authenticate(strgy,cb)(req,res,mysteryFn)`| Parses credentials from the session.  If you're not logged in, it parses credentials from the request, then calls the `verify()` fn you set up when configuring the strategy.  Finally it calls its callback (`cb`).
 `req.login()`                                  | Calls the `seralizeUser()` fn you set up when configuring passport and stuffs the user in the session.
 `req.logout()`                                 | Calls the `deseralizeUser()` fn you set up when configuring passport and rips the user out of the session.
 `req.logout()`                                 | Calls the `deseralizeUser()` fn you set up when configuring passport.
